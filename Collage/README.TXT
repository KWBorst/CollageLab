PROJECT TITLE: Collage Lab
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Create a collage based around an original picture
VERSION or DATE: May 7, 2018
AUTHOR: Kevin Borst
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
1: The first picture in the collage is the unchanged, original picture. 

2: The second picture in the collage is a negated version of the picture, with the negation code from the color lab being 
   utilized.

3: The third picture is a vertically mirrored version of the picture, with the left half being mirrored onto the right half. The
   vertical mirror method learned in class is utilized. 

4: The fourth picture is a horizontally mirrored version of the picture, with the top half being mirrored onto the bottom half.
   The horizontal method learned in class is utilized. The fourth picture additionally has its red value swapped with its green
   value, its blue value with its red value, and its green value with its blue value. This code is taken from the color lab.

5: The fifth picture is a recursive manipulation of the picture, with continuously smaller versions of the picture being made in
   the left corner over and over again. The copySmaller method learned in class is utilized, with an extra parameter that decides
   how much is added to the source coordinates in the for loop and is multiplied by 2 until a certain value is reached.

6: The sixth picture blends the original picture with another. The RGB values of both pictures are taken and then averaged, and 
   the copy method learned in class is utilizedto correctly copy the second picture onto the original with the averaged RGB values.

7: The seventh picture does the same horizontal mirror as the fourth, except the mirrored half is in the opposite direction, thanks
   to some manipulation to the method to copy the mirroed half in the opposite direction. This picture then is grayscaled using the
   grayscale method from the color lab.

8: The eighth picture creates four smaller versions of the picture using the copySmaller method's for loop in four different ways 
   to hit the correct coordinates. My own color scheme code from the Shepard Fairey Lab is then applied to these four pictures.

9: The ninth picture applies the Shepard Fairey code from the Shepard Fairey Lab to the picture.
